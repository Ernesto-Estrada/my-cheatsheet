                    <h2>The Box Model</h2>
                    <p>A box in CSS consists of a content area, which is where any text, images, or other HTML elements are displayed. This is optionally surrounded by padding, a border, and a margin, on one or more sides. The box model describes how these elements work together to create a box as displayed by CSS.</p>
